Topic Extraction from Images and Texts
==============================

A machine learning application to extract top N topics from a corpus of texts and images. This repository includes all the codes for processing the data, building &amp; training the machine learning model, along the with the web app source code using Streamlit and FastAPI.

Project progression:   
- [x] Research and read about the topic modeling problem domain.
- [x] Come up with a prototype solution that uses pretrained models.
- [x] Create explanations for ideas and training models in Jupyter Notebook.
- [x] Create TopicModelling class to encapsulate the prototype solution.
- [ ] Create frontend client with Streamlit.
- [ ] Create backend service with FastAPI and MongoDB.
- [ ] Testing.
- [ ] Deploy the web app.
- [ ] Re-evaluate prototype solution to make improvements.
